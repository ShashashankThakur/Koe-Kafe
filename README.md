# Koe The Kafe

This web app was created for a cafe called Koe The Kafe to participate in the Google Winter of Code (GWoC) organized by our university's Google Developer Student Club. We developed a captivating website that captures the essence of Koe Cafe's unique charm and exceptional coffee experience.


## Problem Statement

- Develop a dynamic website for Koe Cafe, a premium establishment with in-house  coffee roasting, live streaming capabilities, and an extensive menu featuring authentic continental flavors.
- Highlighting specialties in coffee, bread, and cheeses, the website will serve as a platform for patrons to explore Koe Cafe's ambiance and offerings.


## Specifications

 - Build a sleek website for Koe Cafe, emphasizing its premium features like in-house coffee roasting, live streaming, and an extensive continental menu.
 - Focus on coffee, bread, and cheeses as Koe Cafe's specialties.
 - Highlight an upcoming coffee workshop on the website, teasing the exciting prospects of coffee identification, grading, roasting, blending, and cupping.
 - Streamline navigation by excluding a menu page; instead, include a direct link for users to access the extensive menu effortlessly.
 - Infuse creativity into the design to mirror Koe Cafe's pretty ambiance and commitment to premium experiences.
 - The website should be responsive- accessible from laptops and other devices.
